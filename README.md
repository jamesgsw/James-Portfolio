# James-Portfolio

The link for my portfolio website can be found [here.](https://jamesgsw.github.io/James-Portfolio/)

I intended the use for my portfolio website to give a more concise overview and visually appealing of my portfolio, to supplement my Github and Linkedin Account. In addition, I intend to post resources and share my project findings using this website.

Special thanks to [Mr Nantasenamat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanin-nantasenamat/) and [Mr Ken Jee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/) for their tutorial video on how to create a portfolio website on their [youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8)
