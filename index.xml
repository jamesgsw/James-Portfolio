      <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal Project - As graduation approaches, I decided that it would be beneficial to get an overview of the Data centred jobs in Singapore.

      <description>Passionate about tech. Striving to make this world a better place.
Hello there! I&amp;rsquo;m a technology enthusiast, majoring in Business Analytics with a Minor in Artificial Intelligence at Singapore University of Technology and Design(SUTD). On top of going through the academic routine, I regularly engage myself in personal and external projects and competitions that I believe would enrich my professional and individual life.
Iâ€™m a big believer that the university journey is what you make out of it, actively putting yourself out and finding activities and like-minded individuals to develop yourself.</description>
