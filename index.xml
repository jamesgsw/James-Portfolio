      <description>Personal Project - The goal of undertaking this project was 3 prong. (1) Apply my knowledge in A* Path Finding algorithm,(2) Structure the code with Object Oriented Programming(OOP) technique and (3) Document the process with software architecture design.
The project was built with Python and utilised the Python package PyGame to build the visualisation.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;University Academic Project - This project was an academic project for my first programming module in University. The project utilised electrical engineering knowledge alongside Python programming knowledge to develop a product that consists of a Graphical User Interface(GUI) where users can interact with to gain information on the crowd in the elevator. And a electrical circuit system consisting of trip wires and ultrasonic sensors to allow us to derive the flow of users of the elevator and the floor on which the elevator is serving&lt;/p&gt;</description>
