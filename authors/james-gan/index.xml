Industry Hackathon - In my penultimate year, I took part in Shopee&#39;s Code League Hackathon 2020 which was for the first time completely held online due to the novel coronavirus situation. The challenge was held over the course of 8 week where there were 8 challenges that overlapped each other in the field of data science, machine learning, data analysis and natural language processing.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal Project - As graduation approaches, I decided that it would be beneficial to get an overview of the Data centred jobs in Singapore. Therefore, I decided to scrap the popular job site, Glassdoor, to gather data on the jobs on the market and have the bigger picture of the job market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
